## 🌳 The Challenge

Climate change, deforestation, ocean pollution, and biodiversity loss threaten our planet's future. Traditional environmental funding faces critical challenges:

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| 💔 **Inconsistent Funding** | NGOs struggle with unpredictable donation cycles |
| 🔍 **Lack of Transparency** | Donors unsure where money actually goes |
| 🌐 **Geographic Barriers** | Limited global participation |
| 📉 **Economic Sensitivity** | Funding drops during downturns |
