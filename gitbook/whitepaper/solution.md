# 💡 Solution

## 🌳 Sylvan Token: Blockchain-Powered Environmental Funding

Sylvan Token solves the challenges of environmental funding through innovative blockchain technology.

---

## 1️⃣ Automated Funding Mechanism

### Universal 1% Transaction Fee

Every SYL transaction automatically distributes funds to support the environment:

```
Transaction Fee Distribution:

50% → Operations (Development, Marketing, Partnerships)
25% → Environmental NGOs (Direct Donations)
25% → Burn Address (Deflationary Mechanism)
```

### Benefits

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| ♾️ **Continuous** | Funding flows with every transaction |
| 🤖 **Automated** | No manual process required |
| 🔍 **Transparent** | All distributions verifiable on-chain |
| 💸 **Low Overhead** | Minimal administrative costs |

## 2️⃣ Deflationary Economics

### Dual Burn Mechanism

**Transaction Burns:**
- 25% of every transaction fee is burned
- Permanently reduces circulating supply

**Vesting Burns:**
- 10% of every vested token release is burned
- Additional deflationary pressure

### Impact Over Time

| Year | Projected Supply | Reduction |
|------|-----------------|-----------|
| 2025 | 1,000,000,000 | 0% |
| 2026 | ~970,000,000 | 3% |
| 2027 | ~935,000,000 | 6.5% |
| 2028 | ~895,000,000 | 10.5% |
| 2030 | ~800,000,000 | 20% |

**Economic Effect:** Reduced supply + sustained demand = increased scarcity and potential value

## 3️⃣ Transparent Impact Tracking

### On-Chain Verification

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Donation Records** | Immutable blockchain entries |
| **Real-time Dashboard** | Live impact metrics |
| **Quarterly Reports** | Detailed impact analysis |
| **NGO Tracking** | Direct wallet monitoring |

### Verification Process

```
Step 1: Fee Collection (Automatic)
         ↓
Step 2: Pre-Announcement (48h before transfer)
         ↓
Step 3: On-Chain Transfer
         ↓
Step 4: Post-Transfer Verification (24h after)
         ↓
Step 5: Impact Reporting (Quarterly)
```

## 4️⃣ Advanced Vesting System

### Ensures Long-Term Commitment

| Category | Schedule | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Admin Wallets** | 10% immediate + 90% over 20 months | Team alignment |
| **Locked Reserve** | 34-month vesting, 3% monthly | Long-term stability |
| **Advisors** | 10% immediate + 5% monthly for 20 months | Partner commitment |

### Proportional Burning

- 10% of each vested release is automatically burned
- Creates additional deflationary pressure
- Aligns incentives with token value
