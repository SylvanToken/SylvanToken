# ❓ Problem Statement

## 🌍 Current Challenges in Environmental Funding

Environmental organizations worldwide face significant challenges in securing consistent, transparent funding for their vital work.

## 1️⃣ Funding Gaps

### The Challenge

- Environmental NGOs face chronic underfunding
- Traditional donation models are inconsistent and unpredictable
- Administrative overhead reduces actual environmental impact
- Small organizations struggle to reach donors

### Statistics

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Funding Gap** | $300B annual shortfall in environmental funding |
| **Overhead Costs** | 15-30% of donations go to administration |
| **Donor Fatigue** | Declining repeat donation rates |
| **Geographic Limits** | 80% of funding goes to 20% of projects |

## 2️⃣ Transparency Issues

### The Challenge

- Donors often lack visibility into fund usage
- Impact measurement is difficult and inconsistent
- Trust issues with intermediary organizations
- Delayed or incomplete reporting

### Impact

{% hint style="warning" %}

## 3️⃣ Sustainability Concerns

### The Challenge

- Project continuity threatened by irregular income

### The Cycle

```
Economic Downturn
       ↓
Reduced Donations
       ↓
NGO Budget Cuts
       ↓
Reduced Environmental Work
       ↓
Environmental Degradation
       ↓
Cycle Continues...
