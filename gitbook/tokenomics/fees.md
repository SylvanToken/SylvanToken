## 🔥 Burn Mechanism

**25% of every fee is permanently destroyed:**

- Tokens sent to burn address: `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD`
- Verifiable on-chain
- Reduces total circulating supply
- Creates deflationary pressure

**Impact:** Higher trading volume = more tokens burned = increased scarcity
