# Setup Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file to .env: cp .env.example .env
# 2. Fill in your actual values in the .env file
# 3. NEVER commit the .env file to git (it's in .gitignore)

# Deployment Configuration
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CRITICAL: NEVER commit real private keys or API keys!

# Your wallet's private key for deployment
# Get this from your wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.)
# KEEP THIS SECRET! Anyone with this key can access your funds!
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE

# BSCScan API Key for contract verification
# Get this from: https://bscscan.com/myapikey
# Free to create, used for verifying contracts on BSCScan
BSCSCAN_API_KEY=YOUR_BSCSCAN_API_KEY_HERE

# Role Separation Configuration (Enhanced Security)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Separates deployer (who deploys) from owner (who has admin control)
# This is a security best practice for production deployments

# DEPLOYER WALLET ADDRESS
# The wallet that deploys the contract and pays gas fees
# Can be a hot wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.)
# Only needs enough BNB for deployment gas fees (~0.1-0.2 BNB)
# Will have admin privileges (deployer = owner for this deployment)
# Example: Founder Wallet (deploys contract AND has admin control)
# Note: Same wallet for both deployer and owner
DEPLOYER_ADDRESS=0x465b54282e4885f61df7eB7CcDc2493DB35C9501

# OWNER WALLET ADDRESS
# The wallet that will have administrative control over the contract
# For this deployment: SAME as deployer (no ownership transfer)
# Can be a standard wallet for testnet/localhost testing
# Needs BNB balance for deployment gas fees
# Will have full control over all onlyOwner functions
# Example: Founder Wallet (same as deployer)
OWNER_ADDRESS=0x465b54282e4885f61df7eB7CcDc2493DB35C9501

# OWNER WALLET TYPE
# Specifies the type of wallet used for ownership
# Options: hardware, multisig, standard
# Recommended: hardware or multisig for mainnet, standard for testnet
# Current: standard (Trust Wallet is a mobile hot wallet, not hardware)
OWNER_WALLET_TYPE=standard

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Role Separation Security Notes
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# WHY SEPARATE ROLES?
# - Deployer wallet is exposed during deployment (hot wallet, online)
# - Owner wallet can remain in cold storage (hardware wallet, offline)
# - Compromised deployer wallet cannot affect contract after deployment
# - Owner wallet only needs to be online for admin operations
# 
# MAINNET REQUIREMENTS:
# ✓ Deployer and owner MUST be different addresses
# ✓ Owner SHOULD be a hardware wallet (Ledger, Trezor) or multisig
# ✓ Deployer needs 0.2+ BNB for gas fees
# ✓ Owner does not need BNB initially
# 
# TESTNET/LOCALHOST:
# ✓ Deployer and owner CAN be the same address (for testing)
# ✓ Standard wallets are acceptable
# ✓ Good place to test ownership transfer process
# 
# EXAMPLES:
# 
# For Mainnet (Current Configuration):
# DEPLOYER_ADDRESS=0xf949f50B3C32bD4cDa7D2192ff8f51dd9db4A469  (Sylvan Token Wallet)
# OWNER_ADDRESS=0x465b54282e4885f61df7eB7CcDc2493DB35C9501     (Founder Wallet - Trust Wallet)
# OWNER_WALLET_TYPE=standard  (Trust Wallet is a mobile wallet, not hardware)
# 
# For Testnet (Testing):
# DEPLOYER_ADDRESS=0x1234...abcd  (Test wallet)
# OWNER_ADDRESS=0x1234...abcd     (Same as deployer - OK for testing)
# OWNER_WALLET_TYPE=standard
# 
# For Mainnet with Multisig (Highest Security):
# DEPLOYER_ADDRESS=0x1234...abcd  (Hot wallet with BNB)
# OWNER_ADDRESS=0x9abc...def0     (Gnosis Safe multisig address)
# OWNER_WALLET_TYPE=multisig

# Example Values (DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION)
# ============================================================================
#
# For testing purposes only, you can use Hardhat's default test accounts:
# DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
# 
# This is Hardhat's first test account and should ONLY be used for local testing!
# NEVER use this on mainnet or testnet!

# Security Checklist
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Before deployment, ensure:
# ✓ .env file is in .gitignore
# ✓ Real private keys are ONLY in .env (not in code)
# ✓ API keys are ONLY in .env (not in code)
# ✓ .env file is NEVER committed to git
# ✓ Backup your .env file securely (encrypted storage)
# ✓ Use different keys for testnet and mainnet
# ✓ Run security check: npm run security:check
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
